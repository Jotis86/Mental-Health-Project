# 📊 Data Analysis Project

## 📝 Description
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between mental health and technology usage. It includes data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and a web application using Streamlit. The goal is to understand how different aspects of technology usage, such as social media and gaming, impact mental health indicators like stress levels and sleep patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of a dataset related to mental health and technology usage, including extraction, cleaning, visualization, and the creation of an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## ⚙️ Functionality
This project allows:
- 📥 Extracting and cleaning data.
- 📊 Visualizing data through interactive charts.
- 🌐 Deploying an interactive web application to visualize the results.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **🐍 Python**: Main programming language.
- **📊 Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **📈 Seaborn and Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **🌐 Streamlit**: Creating interactive web applications.
- **📓 Jupyter Notebooks**: Development and documentation of the process.

## 🔄 Development Process
1. **📥 Data Extraction**: Obtaining data from Kaggle.
2. **🧹 Data Cleaning**: Transforming and cleaning the data to ensure its quality.
3. **📊 Data Visualization**: Creating charts to explore and understand the data.
4. **🌐 Web Application Deployment**: Creating an interactive web application to visualize the results.

## 📈 Results
The results of the analysis include:
- 📊 Interactive charts showing the distribution of different variables.
- 🌐 An interactive web application to explore the results.

## 🧠 Conclusions
The conclusions of the project highlight the importance of data cleaning and visualization to understand patterns and trends in the data. The analysis provides insights into how technology usage affects mental health indicators.

1. **Access to Support Systems**:
   - People with better access to support systems tend to engage in more physical activity and report better mental health status.

2. **Impact of Work Environment**:
   - A negative work environment may be associated with fewer hours of sleep.

3. **Use of Online Support**:
   - People who spend more time using online support tend to engage in less physical activity.

4. **Technology and Social Media Usage**:
   - There is no strong relationship between technology usage and social media usage.

5. **Gender and Technology Usage**:
   - Technology usage is similar across different genders in this dataset.

## 📊 Visualizations
The web application includes the following visualizations:
- 📊 Age group distribution.
- 📊 Gender distribution.
- 📊 Technology usage hours by gender.
- 📊 Social media usage hours by gender.
- 📊 Stress level by gender.
- 📊 Gaming hours by gender.
- 📊 Sleep hours distribution by range.
